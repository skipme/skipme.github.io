Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.","isBlank":false,"isHidden":false,"sentenceNum":3,"textA":"Мы исходим из той самоочевидной истины, что все люди созданы равными и наделены их Творцом определенными неотчуждаемыми правами, к числу которых относятся жизнь, свобода и стремление к счастью. Для обеспечения этих прав людьми учреждаются правительства, черпающие свои законные полномочия из согласия управляемых. В случае, если какая-либо форма правительства становится губительной для самих этих целей, народ имеет право изменить или упразднить ее и учредить новое правительство, основанное на таких принципах и формах организации власти, которые, как ему представляется, наилучшим образом обеспечат людям безопасность и счастье. Разумеется, благоразумие требует, чтобы правительства, установленные с давних пор, не менялись бы под влиянием несущественных и быстротечных обстоятельств; соответственно, весь опыт прошлого подтверждает, что люди склонны скорее сносить пороки до тех пор, пока их можно терпеть, нежели использовать свое право упразднять правительственные формы, ставшие для них привычными. Но когда длинный ряд злоупотреблений и насилий, неизменно подчиненных одной и той же цели, свидетельствует о коварном замысле вынудить народ смириться с неограниченным деспотизмом, свержение такого правительства и создание новых гарантий безопасности на будущее становится правом и обязанностью народа. Эти колонии длительное время проявляли терпение, и только необходимость вынуждает их изменить прежнюю систему своего правительства. История правления ныне царствующего короля Великобритании – это набор бесчисленных несправедливостей и насилий, непосредственной целью которых является установление неограниченного деспотизма.
